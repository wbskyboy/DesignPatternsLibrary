/// Why this implementation is thread-safe?
/// Well, static constructors in C# are specified to execute only when an instance of the class
/// is created or a static member is referenced, and to execute only once per AppDomain.
/// Given that, this check for the type being newly constructed needs to be executed whatever else happens,
/// it will be faster than adding extra checking as in the DoubleCheckGreeter example.
/// There are a couple of wrinkles however, because it's not as lazy as other implementations.
/// In particular, if you have static members other than Instance, the first reference to any of these members will create the instance.
/// This is corrected in the <see cref="LocklessFullyLazyGreeter"/> implementation.
